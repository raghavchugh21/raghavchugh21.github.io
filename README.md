# Portfolio 2.0 üëãüèª

### What is this about?
I made this Portfolio because the previous one had too much of text. The new one is inspired by [Britanny Chiang's Portfolio Website](https://github.com/bchiang7). Even though I took clues from her design, I developed the entire website on my own.

The website is made using:
- Vue
- Vuex
- VueRouter

### Can you fork this repo?
Yes, for sure, just make sure that you give credit/ attribution. It took me considerable amount of time to develop this website and hence I expect some credit for the same if you use it for your own portfolio.

### How do I give you credits?
You can give credit by linking back to "shahidshaikh.com".

### Do you have any questions?
Please reach out to me via my email "shahid.sk27595@gmail.com"
